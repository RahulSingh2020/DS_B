# Polymorphism in Python

# What is Polymorphism in Python?

# Polymorphism in Python is the ability of an object to take many forms. In simple words, polymorphism allows us to perform the same action in many different ways


# Polymorphism in Built-in function 
# len()

# Example
students = ['Emma', 'Jessa', 'Kelly']
school = 'ABC School'

# calculate count
print(len(students))
print(len(school))


# Polymorphism With Inheritance
# Using method overriding polymorphism allows us to defines methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. This process of re-implementing the inherited method in the child class is known as Method Overriding.


# Advantage of method overriding

# It is effective when we want to extend the functionality by altering the inherited method. Or the method inherited from the parent class doesnâ€™t fulfill the need of a child class, so we need to re-implement the same method in the child class in a different way.
# Method overriding is useful when a parent class has multiple child classes, and one of that child class wants to redefine the method. The other child classes can use the parent class method. Due to this, we donâ€™t need to modification the parent class code

# Example: Method Overriding

class Vehicle:

    def __init__(self, name, color, price):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color
        self.price = price

    def show(self):
        print('Details:', self.name, self.color, self.price)

    def max_speed(self):
        print('Vehicle max speed is 150')

    def change_gear(self):
        print('Vehicle change 6 gear')


# inherit from vehicle class
class Car(Vehicle):
    def max_speed(self):
        print('Car max speed is 240')

    def change_gear(self):
        print('Car change 7 gear')


# Car Object
car = Car('Car x1', 'Red', 20000)
car.show()
# calls methods from Car class
car.max_speed()
car.change_gear()

# Vehicle Object
vehicle = Vehicle('Truck x1', 'white', 75000)
vehicle.show()
# calls method from a Vehicle class
vehicle.max_speed()
vehicle.change_gear()



# Overrride Built-in Functions
# Example

class Shopping:
    def __init__(self, basket, buyer):
        self.basket = list(basket)
        self.buyer = buyer

    def __len__(self):
        print('Redefine length')
        count = len(self.basket)
        # count total items in a different way
        # pair of shoes and shir+pant
        return count * 2

shopping = Shopping(['Shoes', 'dress'], 'Jessa')
print(len(shopping))


# Polymorphism In Class methods

# Example

class Ferrari:
    def fuel_type(self):
        print("Petrol")

    def max_speed(self):
        print("Max speed 350")

class BMW:
    def fuel_type(self):
        print("Diesel")

    def max_speed(self):
        print("Max speed is 240")

ferrari = Ferrari()
bmw = BMW()

# iterate objects of same type
for car in (ferrari, bmw):
    # call methods without checking class of object
    car.fuel_type()
    car.max_speed()



# Polymorphism with Function and Objects

# Example

class Ferrari:
    def fuel_type(self):
        print("Petrol")

    def max_speed(self):
        print("Max speed 350")

class BMW:
    def fuel_type(self):
        print("Diesel")

    def max_speed(self):
        print("Max speed is 240")

# normal function
def car_details(obj):
    obj.fuel_type()
    obj.max_speed()

ferrari = Ferrari()
bmw = BMW()

car_details(ferrari)
car_details(bmw)


# Polymorphism In Built-in Methods
# The word polymorphism is taken from the Greek words poly (many) and morphism (forms). It means a method can process objects differently depending on the class type or data type.


# Example

students = ['Emma', 'Jessa', 'Kelly']
school = 'ABC School'

print('Reverse string')
for i in reversed('PYnative'):
    print(i, end=' ')

print('\nReverse list')
for i in reversed(['Emma', 'Jessa', 'Kelly']):
    print(i, end=' ')



# Method Overloading

# The process of calling the same method with different parameters is known as method overloading.

# Python does not support method overloading. Python considers only the latest defined method even if you overload the method. Python will raise a TypeError if you overload the method.

# Example

def addition(a, b):
    c = a + b
    print(c)


def addition(a, b, c):
    d = a + b + c
    print(d)


# the below line shows an error
# addition(4, 5)

# This line will call the second product method
addition(3, 7, 5)


# Example:

for i in range(5): print(i, end=', ')
print()
for i in range(5, 10): print(i, end=', ')
print()
for i in range(2, 12, 2): print(i, end=', ')


# Example: User-defined polymorphic method

class Shape:
    # function with two default parameters
    def area(self, a, b=0):
        if b > 0:
            print('Area of Rectangle is:', a * b)
        else:
            print('Area of Square is:', a ** 2)

square = Shape()
square.area(5)

rectangle = Shape()
rectangle.area(5, 3)


# Operator Overloading in Python
# Operator overloading means changing the default behavior of an operator depending on the operands (values) that we use. In other words, we can use the same operator for multiple purposes.


# Example


# add 2 numbers
print(100 + 200)

# concatenate two strings
print('Jess' + 'Roy')

# merger two list
print([10, 20, 30] + ['jessa', 'emma', 'kelly'])



# Overloading + operator for custom objects

# Example

class Book:
    def __init__(self, pages):
        self.pages = pages

# creating two objects
b1 = Book(400)
b2 = Book(300)

# add two objects
print(b1 + b2)


# We can overload + operator to work with custom objects also. Python provides some special or magic function that is automatically invoked when associated with that particular operator.

# Example
# the magic method __add__()


class Book:
    def __init__(self, pages):
        self.pages = pages

    # Overloading + operator with magic method
    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.pages + other.pages

b1 = Book(400)
b2 = Book(300)
print("Total number of pages: ", b1 + b2)
